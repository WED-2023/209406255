[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/89IMDEJr)

The webpage I chose for this assignment is about Jimmy Page, the famous guitarist of Led Zeppelin. The webpage provides basic information about Jimmy for those who may not know him, along with some old images from past performances and a recent photo of him. It also includes a YouTube video of a 1969 performance in Denmark, where the band played "Dazed and Confused" live. Additionally, the website offers options to like Jimmy on Facebook, like the website itself, a QR code for easy sharing with friends, and a contact option in case you want to leave Jimmy a message. :)
